# 🚙 Car-Hub

[Demo Page](https://car-hub-red.vercel.app/)

***Car Hub is lite version of NextJS project that is a part of NextJS paid course done by [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery) channel.***
</br>

***Car hub is a simple app that allows you to browse offers of various cars, just like a car rental application.***
</br>
  
***I decided to do this project because I wanted to consolidate my knowledge of NextJS and try HeadlessUI. HeadlessUI components work well with TailwindCSS so it was much easier to style them than when using MUI. Informations about cars and their specs come from [Cars by API-Ninjas on RapidApi](https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/cars-by-api-ninjas) and images are from [ImaginStudioAPI](https://www.imagin.studio/).***
</br>

***And of course the design is fully responsive.***
 
## ⚒️ Built with:
